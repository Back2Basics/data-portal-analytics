See http://www.austintexas.gov/department/planning for more information. The Growth Concept Map assembles compact and walkable activity centers and corridors, as well as job centers, and coordinates them with future transportation improvements. These centers and corridors allow people to reside, work, shop, access services, people watch, recreate, and hang out without traveling far distances. Within them, the design and scale of buildings and the design and availability of parks and gathering spaces will welcome people of all ages and abilities. They will be walkable, bikable, and connected to one another, the rest of the city, and the region by roads, transit, bicycle routes and lanes, and trails. The activity centers and corridors included on this map identify locations for additional people and jobs above what currently exists on the ground. Unlike more detailed small-area plan maps, the Growth Concept Map provides broad direction for future growth and is not parcel specific. Centers that are already established by existing small-area plans, such as those for East Riverside Drive or Highland Mall, are drawn to reflect those plans. Centers without small-area plans are simply shown with a circle, indicating scale and general location. Specifying boundaries for these centers may occur through small-area plans or general guidelines for implementing this plan.

The Growth Concept Map assembles compact and walkable activity centers and corridors, as well as job centers, and coordinates them with future transportation improvements. These centers and corridors allow people to reside, work, shop, access services, people watch, recreate, and hang out without traveling far distances. Within them, the design and scale of buildings and the design and availability of parks and gathering spaces will welcome people of all ages and abilities. They will be walkable, bikable, and connected to one another, the rest of the city, and the region by roads, transit, bicycle routes and lanes, and trails. The activity centers and corridors included on this map identify locations for additional people and jobs above what currently exists on the ground. Unlike more detailed small-area plan maps, the Growth Concept Map provides broad direction for future growth and is not parcel specific. Centers that are already established by existing small-area plans, such as those for East Riverside Drive or Highland Mall, are drawn to reflect those plans. Centers without small-area plans are simply shown with a circle, indicating scale and general location. Specifying boundaries for these centers may occur through small-area plans or general guidelines for implementing this plan.

692b-xsit,false,data.austintexas.gov,table,Concentrations of Protected Classes from Analysis of Impediments,"A new component of fair housing studies is an analysis of the opportunities residents are afforded in “racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty,” also called RCAPs or ECAPs. An RCAP or ECAP is a neighborhood with significant concentrations of extreme poverty and minority populations.
HUD’s definition of an RCAP/ECAP is:
•	A Census tract that has a non‐white population of 50 percent or more AND a poverty rate of 40 percent or more; OR
•	A Census tract that has a non‐white population of 50 percent or more AND the poverty rate is three times the average tract poverty rate for the metro/micro area, whichever is lower.

Why the 40 percent threshold? The RCAP/ECAP definition is not meant to suggest that a slightly‐lower‐than‐40 percent poverty rate is ideal or acceptable. The threshold was borne out of research that concluded a 40 percent poverty rate was the point at which a neighborhood became significantly socially and economically challenged. Conversely, research has shown that areas with up to 14 percent of poverty have no noticeable effect on community opportunity. (See Section II in City of Austin’s 2015 Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice: http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/NHCD/Reports_Publications/1Analysis_Impediments_for_web.pdf)

Due to the limitations of the platform, the data is not displayed how it is meant to be viewed. Please see the dark red “About” tab for a thumbnail of how the map is ideally viewed and two attachments. One attachment is a description of the metadata and the other attachment provides instructions for how to view the data properly. 
The Strategic Areas show the degree to which City of Austin initiatives overlap each other geographically, representing opportunities for collaboration and coordination of capital investment related to implementing the Imagine Austin Comprehensive Plan. 
The data set is comprised of initiatives that have been formally adopted by City Council or are from department-approved planning documents/reports. Examples include the Imagine Austin Growth Concept map, City Council-approved infrastructure master plans (i.e. the City of Austin Sidewalk Master Plan), City Council-approved Neighborhood Plans, and City Council and/or departmental accepted reports (i.e. the Hispanic-Latino Quality of Life Initiative final report). These initiatives contain recommendations for areas to invest in or focus on certain capital improvements, the geographical boundaries of which are represented in the data set. The areas with the greatest number of overlapping initiatives are indicated by the darker shades, representing areas where capital investment can have a multiplier effect in implementing several city initiatives.
The data is organized around Imagine Austin Priority Program topic areas: Compact and Connected, Nature and City, Creativity and Economy, Healthy and Affordable. The purpose of the LRCSP Strategic Investment Areas Overlay Analysis is to support the identification of: (a) Strategic investment in infrastructure that implements Imagine Austin, (b) Potential cost savings and other efficiencies and (c) Improved outcomes for our capital investments. NOTE: the areas are updated periodically to respond to changes in City plans and policies as reflected in City Council-approved initiatives. 
*The Long-Range CIP Strategic Plan is produced annually, and the Planning Commission uses the plan to make its annual recommendation to the City Manager about projects necessary or desirable to implement the comprehensive plan, per its role in the City Charter.

e7fj-wxvd,false,data.austintexas.gov,table,Power Supply Adjustment/Fuel Charge,"Austin Energy’s Power Supply Adjustment (PSA) and fuel charge are reviewed annually. Generally, changes to the fuel rate are effective on Jan. 1 for the calendar year. Effective FY 2013, the power supply adjustment is set as part of the annual budget process. Fuel Charge rates are established based on the type of electric service required by a customer and fall into one of three levels: secondary, primary or transmission.

Primary Level Customers - This rate is applicable to electric service required by any customer who receives service at 12,500 volts (nominal) to 69,000 volts and whose demand for power does not meet or exceed 3,000 kilowatts at any interval during the most recent June through September billing months as determined by the City of Austin. 

Secondary Level Customers - This rate is applicable to electric service required by residential customers in single-family dwellings, mobile homes, townhouses, or individually metered apartment units. It is also applicable to any business that does not receive power at a primary or transmission level. Currently, some 30,000 businesses receive the secondary Fuel Charge rate.

Transmission Level Customers - This rate is applicable to electric service required by any customer who receives service at 69,000 volts (nominal) or higher. This rate shall be applied for a minimum of one year. 

Primary and transmission voltage level customers (about 90 industrial customers) essentially receive power directly from a substation. This results in reduced line losses between the point of generation and delivery to the customer. These customers also install and maintain their own equipment at their site needed to step down the voltage before the power enters their facility. As a result, primary and transmission customers pay a slightly lower Fuel Charge.",08/20/2015 02:47:04 PM +0000,05/16/2016 09:48:31 PM +0000,Utility,"psa,power supply adjustment,fuel charge,austin energy,energy",166,182,Austin Energy,Shannon Wisner,,Annually

Please see the dark red “About” tab for a thumbnail of how the map is ideally viewed and two attachments. One attachment is a description of the metadata and the other attachment provides instructions for how to view the data properly.
The Strategic Investment Areas map shows the geographic location of unfunded or long-term infrastructure needs identified in the FY 2016-17 LRCSP and the degree to which those future investments could enable recommendations in multiple City of Austin initiatives, as identified in the LRCSP Strategic Areas map (see the CPO LRCSP Strategic Areas dataset on the Open Data Portal). The degree of overlap with multiple City initiatives is indicated by darker shades. The goal of the analysis is to identify strategic areas for collaboration and coordination of capital investment related to implementing Imagine Austin. The data is organized around Imagine Austin Priority Program topic areas: Compact and Connected, Nature and City, Creativity and Economy, Healthy and Affordable. The purpose of the LRCSP Strategic Investment Areas Overlay Analysis is to support the identification of: (a) Strategic investment in infrastructure that implements Imagine Austin, (b) Potential cost savings and other efficiencies and (c) Improved outcomes for our capital investments. NOTE: the areas are updated periodically to respond to changes in both infrastructure needs and City plans and policies, as reflected in City Council-approved initiatives.
*The Long-Range CIP Strategic Plan is produced annually, and the Planning Commission uses the plan to make its annual recommendation to the City Manager about projects necessary or desirable to implement the comprehensive plan, per its role in the City Charter.

Austin Energy contract crews currently trim trees citywide on a six-year cycle, trimming approximately 400 miles of power lines each year. About 50 crews (160 to 170 staff members) are in the field each day. There are approximately 2,400 miles of primary line to maintain. 

Austin Energy is one of the few utilities in the nation that attempts to meet with each property owner in advance of tree trimming. A plan detailing the trimming needed for each tree on a property is discussed and provided to the property owner for their acknowledgment and signature. When property owners refuse to meet or cooperate with scheduling, they receive a refusal letter which indicates when trimming will occur. The number of refusal letters is extremely small, less than 1% annually.",09/06/2016 06:39:32 PM +0000,09/06/2016 06:39:37 PM +0000,Utility,"vegetation management,tree,line clearance,property,energy",16,19,Austin Energy,Elaine Lee,,Annually

One major strategy to achieve this goal was to implement a telework pilot.  ARR developed a telework policy and provided training to all participating employees and their managers.  The telework pilot ran from February 8, 2016, to May 6, 2016.  During this time, measures were taken regarding employees' schedules and commute habits as well as miles driven and estimated MPG of their cars in order to calculate emissions.  Surveys were also taken to gauge employee satisfaction and productivity associated with teleworking.  After reviewing the data and results from the pilot, ARR Director Bob Gedert approved the telework pilot to make it an official departmental program in July, 2016.",08/29/2016 07:31:12 PM +0000,08/29/2016 07:31:24 PM +0000,,"arr,austin resource recovery,telework,telecommute",19,18,Austin Resource Recovery,erin.benoit@austintexas.gov,,As Needed

The Austin Energy Resource & Climate Protection Plan approved by the Austin City Council in 2010 set a target of achieving 35% renewable resources by 2020. This includes 200 megawatts of solar capacity and 1,000 megawatts of wind power. During fiscal year 2012, about 15% of the power delivered from Austin Energy to its customers came from renewable resources. Purchase power agreements for wind, solar and biomass power will bring our renewable portfolio to 23% by the end of 2013.

In June 2013 the Austin City Council approved three new wind contracts totaling 570 megawatts which will put the utility four years ahead of schedule for achieving its 35% renewable energy resources goal by 2020. Those new wind projects will come online between 2014 and 2016.

Austin Energy's first utility-scale solar facility known as the Webberville Solar Project began producing electricity in December 2011. The utility is purchasing all of the electricity produced from the 30-megawatt facility over the next 25 years. Austin Energy is also purchasing all power generated from a 100-megawatt biomass plant which went online in June 2012 (20-year contract).",08/02/2016 04:02:25 PM +0000,09/20/2016 02:05:18 PM +0000,Utility,"renewable resources,austin energy,energy",13,26,Austin Energy,Elaine Lee,,As Needed

fnns-rqqh,false,data.austintexas.gov,table,Weatherization Assistance Program,"Austin Energy offers free weatherization services to qualifying low-income, elderly and physically/mentally disabled customers. Each of the homes reduces its energy use by an average of about 1,200 kilowatt-hours annually due to these improvements. The program provides up to $1,500 in home improvements including installation of attic insulation, sealing and repair of ducts, solar screen installations, weather stripping around entry doors, and minor home repairs necessary to improve the effectiveness of the efficiency improvements.

In FY 2010, Austin Energy received a grant of nearly $5.9 million from American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds that allowed for the weatherization of 1,064 homes and apartments for low-income, elderly, and disabled customers within Austin Energy’s service area. Under this program, each dwelling received, on average, about $5,000 worth of improvements including new energy efficient appliances and air conditioning and heating equipment.

Because Austin Energy's implementation of the program was so successful, the utility received additional funding on three separate occasions in the amounts of $2.1 million, $200,000 and $1 million, for total funds of $9.2 million. This allowed the utility to nearly double the number of units receiving this enhanced free weatherization. 
Under the Federal Weatherization Program which ended April 30, 2012, Austin Energy weatherized  1,886 homes, 77% more than the original goal of 1,064 homes. The homes were occupied by 4,529 people of whom 645 were elderly, 572 had disabilities and 758 were children under the age of 5. On average, each of the homes will save about 1,200 kilowatt-hours annually in energy costs due to the improvements.

*In FY 2010 127 of the 456 homes received weatherization through the use of ARRA funds. 
*In FY 2011 all homes received weatherization through the use of ARRA funds. 
*In FY 2012, the 715 homes used both ARRA funds and AE funds.

Austin Energy has approximately 850 megawatts of wind power through purchase power agreements with terms ranging from 10 to 25 years, and one short-term agreement. Austin Energy set a goal that 35% of energy delivered to customers will come from renewable resources by 2020. In January 2013, two new wind contracts went online adding an additional 293.9 megawatts of wind power.  Additionally, Austin Energy is purchasing energy produced from the 30 megawatt Webberville Solar Project and a 100 megawatt biomass plant which went online in June 2012. Purchase power agreements for wind, solar and biomass power will bring our renewable portfolio to 23% by the end of 2013. In June 2013 the Austin City Council approved three new wind contracts totaling 570 megawatts which will put the utility four years ahead of schedule for meeting its 35% renewable energy resources goal by 2020.
